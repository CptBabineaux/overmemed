Meme overthrow custom game by dota 2 modders

Heroes can be based on any silly idea, this is a meme mod afterall, anything goes. Heros can be based on anything, it can be a joke within dota 2 community (like a hero with pocket riki ability), it can be a parochial joke that only Russians will get (petri reborn), it can be based upon a joke in the modding community (A hero that has an ultimate that is always in development and never gets released or a hero that doesnt have any skills himself and has to steal or pay for skills), they can have basic abilities with just different names or it can be a super complicated hero with all original abilities, anything, the main thing is to have fun and not be too serious.
